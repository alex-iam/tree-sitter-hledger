# Tree-Sitter HLedger Grammar TODO

## Completed Features ‚úÖ

### Core Grammar (High Priority)
- [x] **Set up basic grammar structure** - source_file and journal rules
- [x] **Implement transaction parsing** - date, status, code, description  
- [x] **Implement posting parsing** - account, amount, comments
- [x] **Add account name parsing** - hierarchy support with colons
- [x] **Implement amount and commodity parsing** - multiple currencies and formats
- [x] **Create comprehensive test corpus** - all syntax elements covered

### Extended Features (Medium Priority)  
- [x] **Add support for different date formats** - YYYY/MM/DD, YYYY-MM-DD
- [x] **Implement comment parsing** - semicolon comments (line and inline)
- [x] **Add directive parsing** - account, commodity, price declarations

### Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- [x] **Support virtual postings** - parentheses `(account)` and brackets `[account]` syntax

## Pending Features üîÑ

### Advanced Syntax (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Add balance assertions and assignments support** - `= $100`, `== $100` syntax
- [ ] **Implement cost and price syntax** - `@`, `@@` for unit costs and total costs  
- [ ] **Add periodic transaction support** - `~` prefix for recurring transactions

## Known Issues üêõ

### Edge Cases from Corpus Tests
- [ ] **Negative number amounts** - `-100 USD` format not parsing correctly
- [ ] **Transactions without descriptions** - some edge cases in parsing

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] **Enhanced error recovery** - better handling of malformed syntax
- [ ] **More date formats** - support for additional date separators and formats
- [ ] **Extended comment syntax** - support for `#` and `*` comment prefixes
- [ ] **Account aliases** - support for account aliasing syntax
- [ ] **Include directives** - support for file inclusion

## Grammar Design Notes üìù

### Current Architecture
- **Hidden nodes** used for `_commodity` and `_number` for cleaner syntax highlighting
- **Choice structures** for handling multiple amount formats
- **Optional sequences** for transaction metadata (status, code, description)
- **Repeat structures** for postings and file-level elements

### Design Decisions
- Prioritized practical syntax highlighting over perfect AST representation
- Focused on most common HLedger use cases first
- Maintained simple, testable grammar rules
- Used incremental development approach

### Testing Strategy
- Corpus tests split by feature area (`amounts.txt`, `transactions.txt`, etc.)
- High-signal tests covering edge cases and variations
- Test expectations updated when changing AST structure
- Comprehensive coverage of implemented features

## Development Workflow üîß

### When Adding New Features
1. Add todo item with appropriate priority
2. Create minimal test case first
3. Implement grammar rule incrementally  
4. Add comprehensive corpus tests
5. Update AST expectations if needed
6. Mark todo as completed

### When Fixing Issues
1. Create minimal reproduction case
2. Debug with `npx tree-sitter parse`
3. Fix one issue at a time
4. Verify fix doesn't break existing tests
5. Update corpus tests if needed
